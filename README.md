# muscle_tendon_mechanics

Simulates the force transmission of a tendon induced by the stimulation of the corresponding muscle.
The muscle model is based on the multi-phyiscs model introduced by Heidlauf et al (2013,2014,2016,2017).
In contrast to the original model, the passive material behaviour (of both muscle and tendon) is simulated by a hyperelastic, isotroptic Ogden-type material. 

Note that the example needs to be executed from the main folder, containing a subfolder with all the nessecary input files, i.e., the corresponding cellml model. Otherwise the path to the cellml-file needs to be adapted.
