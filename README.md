# muscle_tendon_mechanics

Simulates the force transmission of a tendon induced by a stimulation of the corresponding muscle.
The muscle model is based on Heidlauf et al (2013,2014,2016,2017).
In contrast to the original model, the passive material behabiour is simulated by a hyperelastic, isotroptic Ogden-type material.
